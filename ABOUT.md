Welcome to fitio Page
================

Hello, We are a bunch of friends of Faculty of Information Technology, University of Moratuwa, the best tech university in Sri Lanka. We are interested in new technologies and we love coding.

One day one of our members got the email saying that there will be a virtual hackathon O_o, never heard about that kind of thing. He just applied it just for fun and curious, he never had a clue that he'll be in. Then after some days he got the e mail that saying he was selected and can form a group. So here we are fitio :-)
